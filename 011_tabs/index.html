          <div class="contents__desc">
            Lee Ji-eun (Korean: Ïù¥ÏßÄÏùÄ; Hanja: ÊùéÁü•ÊÅ©; born May 16, 1993), known
            professionally as IU, is a South Korean singer-songwriter and
            actress. The name IU is a combination of 'I' and 'You,' meaning "you
            and I become one with music." She signed with Kakao M (formerly LOEN
            Entertainment, now Kakao Entertainment) in 2007 as a trainee and
            debuted as a singer at the age of fifteen with her first mini album
            Lost and Found. Although her follow-up albums, Growing Up and
            IU...IM, brought mainstream success, it was after the release of
            "Good Day" (Korean: Ï¢ãÏùÄ ÎÇ†), the lead single from her 2010 album
            Real, that she achieved national stardom. "Good Day" went on to
            spend five consecutive weeks at the top position of South Korea's
            Gaon Digital Chart, and in 2019, it was ranked number one on
            Billboard's "100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s" list.

            IU has released a total of five studio albums and nine extended
            plays in her career, scoring three number-one albums and twenty-six
            number-one singles on the Gaon Music Charts. One of the best-selling
            solo acts in the group-dominated K-pop industry, she has been
            included on Forbes magazine's annual Korea Power Celebrity list
            since 2012 and reached a peak ranking of number three that year.
            Billboard recognized IU as the all-time leader of its Korea K-Pop
            Hot 100 chart with the most number-one songs and the artist who has
            held the number-one position for the most weeks. According to a
            Gallup Korea survey, she was the most popular idol and artist among
            South Koreans in 2017.
